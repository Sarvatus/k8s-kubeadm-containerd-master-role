k8s-kubeadm-containerd-role
=========

An ansible role for installing k8s based on cri containerd via kubeadm on Linux CentOS8.

Requirements
------------

- A compatible Linux host. The Kubernetes project provides generic instructions for Linux distributions based on Debian and Red Hat, and those distributions without a package manager.
- 2 GB or more of RAM per machine (any less will leave little room for your apps).
- 2 CPUs or more.
- Full network connectivity between all machines in the cluster (public or private network is fine).
- Unique hostname, MAC address, and product_uuid for every node.
- Certain ports are open on your machines

Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Dependencies
------------

A list of other roles hosted on Galaxy should go here, plus any details in regards to parameters that may need to be set for other roles, or variables that are used from other roles.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
